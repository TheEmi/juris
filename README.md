## 🚀 Why Juris?

**Traditional frameworks force you to choose:** Build everything as a JavaScript app OR stick with static HTML. Juris gives you both.

- ✅ **Progressive Enhancement** - Enhance existing HTML with reactive behavior
- ✅ **Complete Applications** - Build full SPAs with components and routing  
- ✅ **Headless Services** - Background processing without UI
- ✅ **Object-First Architecture** - Define interfaces as pure JavaScript objects
- ✅ **Intentional Reactivity** - Choose what's reactive, when it's reactive
- ✅ **Zero Dependencies** - 45kb complete framework, no external libraries
- ✅ **7x Faster Performance** - Surgical DOM updates, no virtual DOM overhead

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# NPM
npm install jurisjs

# CDN
<script src="https://unpkg.com/jurisjs@latest/dist/juris.min.js"></script>

# Download
wget https://jurisjs.com/juris.js
```

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Progressive Enhancement
Enhance existing HTML elements with reactive behavior while maintaining content visibility before JavaScript loads.

### Complete Applications  
Build full SPAs with components, routing, and state management using object-first architecture.

### Headless Services
Create background services for data sync, analytics, or any processing that doesn't require UI.

## 🧬 Core Concepts

### **States**
Simple, flat state management with dot notation access. Reactive updates trigger only where needed.

### **Enhancement** 
Transform existing HTML elements into reactive components. Content works before JavaScript loads.

### **Components**
Reusable UI definitions as pure JavaScript objects. Support lifecycle hooks and nested composition.

### **Router**
Built-in routing with hash or history mode, route guards, lazy loading, and nested routes.

### **Headless Components**
Background services that run without UI. Perfect for data synchronization, analytics, or system monitoring.
